To</p><p>indicate this, you can use a question mark (?) to replace the digits which can vary. For example, 1631940????</p><p>can be used to represent 16319401234, 16319409890, or 16319403214.</p><p>The ? character can appear anywhere in a string. For example, 16319405?00 could represent 16319405000,</p><p>16319405100, 16319405200, 16319405300, 16319405400, 16319405500, 16319405600, 16319405700, 16319405800</p><p>or 16319405900.</p><p>An asterisk (*) can be used to replace any combination of characters, in any quantity. For example, 1631940*</p><p>can be used to represent 16319401234, 16319409890, 16319401, 163194000000000.</p><p>CCSP Admin Help - Tenant - 7.4</p><p>21</p><p>Multiple administrators</p><p>Depending on how your contact center is configured, more than one administrator user may be logged on</p><p>simultaneously.</p><p>Simultaneous updates</p><p>If two administrator users open an item for update, the first user to click OK in the dialog succeeds with the</p><p>update.

Telephone carriers use this</p><p>information to identify authorized users, such as a particular tenant. This is not Caller ID and is not shown to</p><p>the called party. CCSP sends this information to the remote party in a SIP INVITE message. The telephone</p><p>carrier provides this value.</p><p>l</p><p>P-asserted-identity TEL — the phone number in TEL URI format. This information is similar to P-Asserted-</p><p>Identity SIP but in telephone format and is sent in a SIP INVITE message.</p><p>l</p><p>Identity of transfer from IVR — whether and how to transfer caller identity to the third party. Used only</p><p>for calls transferred from IVR script (by using the Bridge and Transfer Designer blocks). The options are:</p><p>o</p><p>Of the original call (default) — ANI, PAI, and privacy transferred to the third party are copied from the</p><p>original inbound leg of the call.</p><p>o</p><p>Anonymous — the third party does not receive the identity of the caller or the tenant.</p><p>o</p><p>Of the tenant — the third party of a transferred call receives the tenant's caller ID.</p><p>l</p><p>Identity of outgoing call — whether and how to transfer the identity of the original caller to the called</p><p>party. Used for calls transferred by agents or regular outgoing calls made by agents. The options are:</p><p>o</p><p>Of the original call (default) — if a call is transferred by agent, the identity of the original caller is</p><p>transferred to the called party. For a regular outgoing call, the identity of the individual agent, if it is</p><p>assigned, is transferred to the called party.</p><p>o</p><p>Anonymous — the identities of the original caller and the tenant are not disclosed.</p><p>o</p><p>Of the tenant — the called party receives the individual agent caller ID, if it is assigned.</p><p>l</p><p>When caller requests privacy — whether to show caller identities to the tenant. Caller identity is usually</p><p>stripped from a call by caller request even before the call arrives at CCSP. For example, if the system is</p><p>installed in an enterprise or in a service provider that is not a carrier, the setting has no effect on the system.</p><p>If installed in the core of a carrier network, CCSP may receive caller identities even if callers ask to hide it.</p><p>The system administrator may decide to show caller identities to the tenant. This parameter is also used by</p><p>H.323. The options are:</p><p>o</p><p>Do not hide (default) — pass the caller's identity and do not hide it. Ignore the caller's request.</p><p>o</p><p>Hide from agent — hide only from agents. The identity is available for scripts and reports.</p><p>o</p><p>Hide everywhere — hide everywhere. Calls where the caller asks to hide his identity appear as</p><p>Anonymous for agents, scripts, and reports.</p><p>l</p><p>Relay display name — whether to relay the display name to other call participants. The display name is a</p><p>textual description of the caller, such as the person’s name. If the caller has requested privacy and caller ID</p><p>appears as Anonymous, no display name is associated with the call, regardless of this setting.</p><p>CCSP Admin Help - Tenant - 7.4</p><p>33</p><p>Manage other tenant properties</p><p>Caution</p><p>We highly recommend that you enable Use folder segregation.</p><p>When folder segregation is disabled:</p><p>l</p><p>The following folders are not visible to agents and regular supervisors:</p><p>o</p><p>Rejected Emails, Deleted Emails, Replied, Not Replied, Drafts, Outbox, Sent Items</p><p>o</p><p>Deleted Callbacks</p><p>o</p><p>Voicemail, Archived Voicemails, Rejected Voicemails, Deleted Voicemails</p><p>l</p><p>Agents and regular supervisors can only see their own callbacks marked with "call-to-me" and their own</p><p>personal (not shared) deferred emails/voicemails.</p><p>On the Tenant Properties page, on the Others tab, view/enter the following information:</p><p>l</p><p>Media devices — the video communications devices available to the tenant.
