<p>Log in
The log in process is slightly different depending on the identity provider configured by your administrator.
Note
l
Reseller administrators can log on to multiple tenants.
l
Admin users can open several tabs in the same browser with one login.
l
If you log in again after your CCSP application session becomes invalid, and while your ADFS or EIS
provider's session is still valid, you do not need to type your password.
1.
In your browser, in the Address bar, type the URL supplied by your supervisor or administrator.
2.
Click Go or press Enter. The Welcome to CCSP Admin page appears.
3.
Click Log in. If you are already logged in, the main CCSP Admin page appears.
4.
If you are not already logged in, the Auth Server Login Selector page appears.
5.
Type your User name in User Principal Name (UPN) format, for example, someone@domainname.com,
and click Continue.
6.
The next step depends on the identity provider configured by your administrator:
o
For Auth Server, the AuthServer login page appears. Type your Password and click Log in.
Alternatively, to change the username, click Back to return to the previous page. The main CCSP Admin
page appears. If necessary, see Password expired message below.
o
For ADFS, you are redirected to the ADFS login page to authenticate. Please consult your local
procedures for how to proceed from this point.
o
For Enghouse Identity Server (EIS), you are redirected to the EIS login page. Type your Password and
click Login. The main CCSP Admin page appears.
7.
If necessary, see Additional login messages below.
Next, see Reseller view or Tenant view.
Password expired message
For Auth Server, if your password has expired or your administrator has set your account to require a password
change at the next login, the next time you enter your password on the Auth Server login page, the Password
expired notification appears.
1.
In the notification, click Change Password. The Change password dialog appears.
2.
In Old Password, type your current password.
3.

<p>Additional login messages
The following messages may appear when you try to log in:
l
Failed to get authorization for Admin use. Your user profile is not permitted to use the CCSP Admin
application. Only landlord, reseller, and tenant administrators are permitted to use the CCSP Admin
application.
l
You are not authorized to view this page. This can occur because:
o
You are logged in to an external identity provider with a different username than the one you entered
on the Auth Server Login Selector page to log in to the CCSP client application.
o
You entered a username on the Auth Server Login Selector page and were redirected to an external
identity provider, where you log on with a different username.
l
Auth Server is not available or there is a misconfiguration. You must contact your administrator. You will not be
able to log in to CCSP Admin until the issue is resolved.

<p>How to use wildcards
A common way to indicate a group of numbers that all have a similar pattern is by using wildcards.
If you have a series of numbers that all begin with 1631940xxxx, only the last four digits are different. To
indicate this, you can use a question mark (?) to replace the digits which can vary. For example, 1631940????
can be used to represent 16319401234, 16319409890, or 16319403214.
The ? character can appear anywhere in a string. For example, 16319405?00 could represent 16319405000,
16319405100, 16319405200, 16319405300, 16319405400, 16319405500, 16319405600, 16319405700, 16319405800
or 16319405900.
An asterisk (*) can be used to replace any combination of characters, in any quantity. For example, 1631940*
can be used to represent 16319401234, 16319409890, 16319401, 163194000000000.

<p>Multiple administrators
Depending on how your contact center is configured, more than one administrator user may be logged on
simultaneously.
Simultaneous updates
If two administrator users open an item for update, the first user to click OK in the dialog succeeds with the
update. When the other user clicks OK, the message The record was updated by another user appears in the
dialog.
Simultaneous update and delete
If an administrator user opens an item for update, and another administrator user deletes the item, when the
first user clicks OK, the message The item does not exist appears in the dialog.
If an administrator user deletes an item, and another administrator user tries to update the item by clicking it
in the list, the warning message The item does not exist appears.

system administrator.
1.
Tell your system administrator about the issue and wait for it to be resolved.
2.
When it is resolved, click OK to close the message dialog.
3.
Click Log out of your CCSP session again.
The application will return to the login page. Depending on the problem resolution, this may take slightly
longer than normal.
Session expiry
Your CCSP application session will become invalid when:
l
The login session time exceeds the maximum CCSP login session lifetime specified by your administrator.
l
You log out of your CCSP session using another application.
l
You clear all cookies in the browser.
When your CCSP application session becomes invalid, you must log in again. See Log in.

<p>Manage core tenant properties
On the Tenant Properties page, on the Core tab, view/enter the following information:
l
Name (required) — the name of the tenant. This name can be different from the Account name.
l
Account name — the name to use for administration only. This value is case-sensitive.
l
Short name (required) — the tenant’s public folder name. The name should not contain any spaces,
underscores, or special characters.
l
Address — the tenant's billing address.
l
Contact person — the main contact person's name.
l
Phone — the main contact person’s phone number or tenant's main number.
l
Email address — the tenant's email address.
l
UPN suffix (required) — the email and logon suffix for all users in the tenant's contact center.
l
Disable historical information for this tenant — whether to disable logging of the tenant's call data to
Historical Reports.
l
Outgoing and direct calls wrap-up timeout (sec) — for how long to wait for agents to exit wrap-up before
automatically timing out the wrap-up of an outdialed or a directly dialed incoming call. The default is 0 (no
timeout).
l
Agent to agent call timeout (sec) — for how long to wait for users to answer before automatically
canceling an agent to agent call request. This value must be between 10-3600. The default is 30.
l
Call answered script timeout (sec) — for how long to run the Call Answered Script. The script stops
running when the timeout value is reached or when the agent hangs up the call. When set to 0, the agent
that has been routed the call waits for the answer script to complete for as long as is needed. The agent can
hang up the call while the call answer script runs, whether or not there is a timeout. The default is 0 (no
timeout).
l
Enable call answered script for PD campaign — whether to play the Call Answered Script for outbound
dialing campaigns. Playing this script causes a two second delay between placing the Predictive Dialing (PD)
call and it being answer by an agent.
l
Media types — the media types available to the tenant.
Note
CCSP does not support calendar invites as a method of call delivery.
l
Aging timeout interval (mins) — for messaging-related incoming calls:
o
For how long a deferred email/voicemail call waits for processing before the system reroutes the call
o
For how long the system waits before removing a call related either to a tenant that is unassigned from
MS or an MS that is down. This allows grace time to assign another MS for a tenant or to wait for MS
recovery after an unexpected failure.
o
The default is 480 minutes.

<p>Manage tenant SIP parameters
Landlord only can change these values.
On the Tenant Properties page, on the SIP parameters tab, view/enter the following information:
l
P-asserted-identity SIP — the SIP equivalent of the ANI in SIP URI format. Telephone carriers use this
information to identify authorized users, such as a particular tenant. This is not Caller ID and is not shown to
the called party. CCSP sends this information to the remote party in a SIP INVITE message. The telephone
carrier provides this value.
l
P-asserted-identity TEL — the phone number in TEL URI format. This information is similar to P-Asserted-
Identity SIP but in telephone format and is sent in a SIP INVITE message.
l
Identity of transfer from IVR — whether and how to transfer caller identity to the third party. Used only
for calls transferred from IVR script (by using the Bridge and Transfer Designer blocks). The options are:
o
Of the original call (default) — ANI, PAI, and privacy transferred to the third party are copied from the
original inbound leg of the call.
o
Anonymous — the third party does not receive the identity of the caller or the tenant.
o
Of the tenant — the third party of a transferred call receives the tenant's caller ID.
l
Identity of outgoing call — whether and how to transfer the identity of the original caller to the called
party. Used for calls transferred by agents or regular outgoing calls made by agents. The options are:
o
Of the original call (default) — if a call is transferred by agent, the identity of the original caller is
transferred to the called party. For a regular outgoing call, the identity of the individual agent, if it is
assigned, is transferred to the called party.
o
Anonymous — the identities of the original caller and the tenant are not disclosed.
o
Of the tenant — the called party receives the individual agent caller ID, if it is assigned.
l
When caller requests privacy — whether to show caller identities to the tenant. Caller identity is usually
stripped from a call by caller request even before the call arrives at CCSP. For example, if the system is
installed in an enterprise or in a service provider that is not a carrier, the setting has no effect on the system.
If installed in the core of a carrier network, CCSP may receive caller identities even if callers ask to hide it.
The system administrator may decide to show caller identities to the tenant. This parameter is also used by
H.323. The options are:
o
Do not hide (default) — pass the caller's identity and do not hide it. Ignore the caller's request.
o
Hide from agent — hide only from agents. The identity is available for scripts and reports.
o
Hide everywhere — hide everywhere. Calls where the caller asks to hide his identity appear as
Anonymous for agents, scripts, and reports.
l
Relay display name — whether to relay the display name to other call participants. The display name is a
textual description of the caller, such as the person’s name. If the caller has requested privacy and caller ID
appears as Anonymous, no display name is associated with the call, regardless of this setting.

Applications refers here to a set of scripts created using Designer that define a call flow. You can define multiple
call flow applications. One of these applications is selected for each call.
Before running a script, CCSP applies a set of rules to determine which application to use. The rules are
checked in the order in which they appear in CCSP Admin, that is, in creation order. The first application whose
rule evaluates to True is selected. If no rule evaluates to True, then CCSP runs the default application.
The call preserves the last selected application ID that was used. However, this application ID is not preserved
when an email or voicemail call is deferred or transferred to system (TTS). If the entry point for TTS has a
configured application ID, then this application ID is preserved instead.
These rules use call parameters to determine which application to run. For voice calls, DNIS is used. For chat
calls, the calling user URL is used, and for messaging calls the email folder name is used.

Click OK.
Creating rules
Rules are used to determine which application (script) is run when a call arrives in the contact center. A rule
consists of a compilable VB script.
To select the application based on the call’s media type, use one of the following logical comparison
statements:
l
MEDIATYPE=CALLBACK
l
MEDIATYPE=VOICEMAIL
l
MEDIATYPE=EMAIL
l
MEDIATYPE=VOIP
l
MEDIATYPE=CHAT
Below are some examples of rules.
DNIS = 6319404200 AND Now > CDate(""8/4/2017 6:54:10 PM""), CDate is a date constant.
CDate(""6:54:10 AM"") < Time And Time < CDate(""6:54:10 PM"")
Date > CDate(""8/4/2017"")
DNIS = 631* AND Date > CDate(""8/4/2017"")
When creating rules:
l
DNIS must be used if you want to specify DNIS.
l
DNIS is not supported when media type is CallBack or VoiceMail.
l
MAILFOLDER represents the last ACD folder name.
l
MAILFOLDEREMAIL represents the last ACD folder email address.
l
MAILFOLDER and MAILFOLDEREMAIL in the same rule are not supported.
l
Now means current date and time.
l
Time represents the current time.
l
Date represents the current date.
l
CDate must have double quotation marks ("") on both sides of the rule.
For email messages rules, instead of DNIS specify MAILFOLDER.
MAILFOLDER = foldername And Date > CDate(""8/4/2017"")
For chat call rules, the Application Name can be specified on the web caller while making a chat call. If an
Application Name is supplied in the web caller, and it matches one of the defined Application Names, that
application (script) is run even though Application Rule doesn't evaluate to TRUE.
Note

<p>Manage interaction profiles
View the Interaction Profiles list
Add an interaction profile
Edit an interaction profile
Delete an interaction profile
Interaction profiles define the rules for how the CMS allocates calls to individual agents. They define the media
types a specific agent can handle, the number of concurrent calls of each type, and any blocking or interruption
rules.
Each interaction profile contains a collection of interaction profile rules, one for each media type, although not
every media type needs to be included. Each existing and new agent (personnel) is assigned to a single
interaction profile. Any new agents are assigned to the profile designated as the default profile for new agents.
The maximum total concurrent interactions per agent are limited to 9. If voice calls are configured to override
this maximum, the limit is 10.
Multi-interaction enables an agent to simultaneously handle multiple calls, up to a configured number between
one and nine. If voice calls are configured to override this maximum, the limit is 10.
In CCSP Admin, you configure the number of interactions each agent can handle using multi-interaction
profiles. You then enable multi-interaction for an agent by assigning the relevant interaction profile to the
agent in the Interaction profile property on the Properties tab of the [Agent name] page. See Manage
personnel properties. Alternatively, you can assign the agent as a member of a multi-interaction profile.

Is default profile for new agents —whether you want all new agents to be assigned to this profile.
Note
There can be only one default interaction profile. When you select the Is default profile for new
agents check box, CCSP automatically clears the corresponding check box on the previous default
profile.
o
Maximum overall interactions — a number between 0 and 9. A value of 0 means that agents assigned

Under Internet, Phone, Email, Callback, and Voicemail enter the following information:
o
[Media type] rule maximum interactions — a number between 0 and 9. A value of 0 means that
agents assigned to this profile cannot handle this media type.
o
[Media type] rule call weighting — a number between 0 and 100, representing the relative weight of
this media type. A value of 100 means the highest weighting. The CMS uses this value to determine
which agent has the least load and should therefore take the next call. For more information, see How
agents are selected in the CCSP Tenant Administrator Guide.
Note
If the weight of a media type is set to zero, the agent is reported as available during the time of a
call from that media. Consequently, in reports an agent can appear as 99% available and at the
same time have handled many calls.
o
[Media type] rule media allowed — agents assigned this interaction profile can handle calls of this
media type. If you want agents assigned this interaction profile not to be allowed to handle this media
type, clear the check box. Selected by default.
o
[Media type] rule overrides maximum interactions — agents can handle chat and email even if that
agent is already handling the maximum overall interactions specified above. Not selected by default.
o
[Media type] rule blocks other media types — agents that are currently interacting with internet
media types, can be routed only the same type of media call. When all internet media type calls are

The CCSP messaging subsystem can interact with an external mailbox to receive and send emails. In this
context, external means that mailbox is stored on a mail server that is external to CCSP.
The external mailbox must be created or purchased separately and must support the IMAP, SMTP network
protocols. When the mailbox exists on a mail server, you can define it in the CCSP Admin so it can be accessed
by CCSP services. The external mailbox must have an email address. There are mail server vendors that allow
adding email address aliases to a given mailbox. In this context, an alias is just another email address given to a
mailbox. You can have one or more mailboxes defined.

In some instances, agents may be constrained to the use of only a circuit switched phone or IP phone. This may
be due to how your contact center is configured, or if the agent is traveling without a computer and still needs
to service calls, or perhaps in the event of a disaster.
Since the agent is operating without a computer, many of the functions that are available through CCSP UI are
not available for the Phone Agent.
Phone agents are created in exactly the same manner as other agents. You must:
l
Assign the agent a numeric Login ID and numeric Password.
l
Enter the agent's phone number into the Phone ANI field of the personnel record.
l

<p>Manage phone aliases
Use wildcards in phone aliases
View the Phone Aliases list
Add a phone alias
Edit a phone alias
Delete a phone alias
Phone aliases can be used to create easily memorized nicknames for particular phone numbers, or to map to
particular numbers or individuals within your organization. They can be thought of as extensions, but they can
be any set of alphanumeric characters, including words or short phrases. When assigning words or phrases to
an alias, any users who would be likely to use the alias should be made aware of its existence.
Use wildcards in phone aliases
A common use for this feature is to create shortcut dialing numbers, similar to speed dialing numbers, for a
company with offices in different locations. If, for example, all of the extensions in your local office begin with
the digit 4 and the extensions in another office begin with 7, you can assign the alias 7000 to the number
+1516557000. Then a person in your office only has to dial 7000 to connect to the person with that number in
the other office.
You can also use a question mark as a wildcard to replace any digits in both the alias and the number to be
dialed. To extend the above example further, you could assign the alias 7??? to the phone number +1516557???
to create shortcuts to all of the extensions in that other office. In a similar manner, you could assign the alias
4??? to your +1631940??? main office phone number.

Caution
The information entered in the Queue: [Name] dialog dictates call flow, sets priorities, and triggers events

o

o

CCSP Admin Help - Tenant - 7.4

<p>o
Timeout in queue — the maximum amount of time a caller should wait in a queue before the call times
out. When a caller's wait in queue exceeds this time, the In Queue Timeout script specified with
Designer runs. When a queue is created, its default in queue timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
Note
Create a separate queue for email (MCS) messages.
For a contact center that receives many email messages, the in queue timeout should be as large as
possible. When the in queue timeout expires, the MCS takes all calls from the Call Matcher, runs the in
queue timeout script and then resubmits them back to the Call Matcher. This would consume
excessive bandwidth if there are a large number of email messages.
For example, if the contact center receives 10,000 message calls a day and it takes 2 days for all the
available agents to answer all 10,000 message calls, a reasonable in queue timeout for the message
queue would be 2 days (172800 seconds).
o
Timeout pickup — the pickup timeout for the queue. When a call rings to an agent and the ringing
time exceeds this time and the agent has not answered the call, the Pick-up Timeout script specified with
Designer runs and routes the call to the next available agent.
Caution
By default, timeout occurs at 75% of the value that you specify. For more information, see
PickUpTimeoutMultiplyer registration key in the CCSP Registry Key Reference.
Note
If you set the pickup timeout to 0, all calls routed to an agent on that queue (incoming or transfer
to system calls) ring indefinitely on the first chosen agent from that queue.
o
Timeout wrap-up — the amount of time allowed for wrap-up activity before the default wrap-up code
