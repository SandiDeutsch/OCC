     1: Intro
The CCSP user interface (UI) is a browser-based application that enables users to receive voice, chat, email,
callback, and voicemail calls that arrive at a contact center. Calls are automatically directed to particular users
because they are available and have the expertise to handle the calls.
CCSP UI was previously called TouchPoint.
Agent Help is for CCSP agents, ReadyReps, and business users that have CCSP UI licenses. Unless otherwise
specified in the instructions in this Help, the term agent refers to both agents and ReadyReps.
What's new
Version 7.4
Contact History — added Contact History, a CCSP add-on for managing contacts and contact account details.
Request a chat consultation — an agent can request a chat consultation during a call (if enabled). Requires
HF74-66036.
Set your preferences — if the selected SIP input and/or output device becomes unavailable during your CCSP
UI login session (for example, it is unplugged from your computer), a warning appears in both CCSP UI and the
notification area of your task bar. Requires HF74-64991.
Refuse a call — when you refuse a call, you may automatically become released if this has been configured by
your system administrator. Requires HF74-64991.
Log in and Log out — added process for CCSP single sign-on. Requires HF74-61362.

Types of CCSP UI users
Supervisor tools
CCSP UI is a browser-based application that enables users to receive calls that arrive at contact center phone
numbers. Calls are automatically directed to particular users because they are available and have the expertise
to handle the calls. Users can also receive chat calls.
If the system administrator provides email service, emails are also directed to the user from email coming into
the business. Users may also be able to receive voice calls on a direct extension.
CCSP can also direct outbound calls to users who participate in outbound dialing campaigns, a capability
provided by the Dialer component of CCSP. As with email, the system administrator must provide this
capability.
CCSP UI Help - Agent - 7.4

    </p>
    <p>
     Types of connections
CCSP provides Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) and direct inward dialing (DID) voice connections to users, in
addition to other media such as email and chat.
ACD automatically queues outside calls and then routes them to those users best able to handle the calls. ACD
also works with CCSP Dialer to route calls for outbound dialing campaigns to users.
DID enables outside callers to dial a user’s specific phone number.
Types of CCSP UI users
Various types of users of the CCSP system can use CCSP UI. The available features differ for each user type and
some features may not apply to your environment.
The types of CCSP UI users are:
l
Business users — standard office workers
l
ReadyReps — knowledge workers and others who sometimes receive ACD-routed calls
l
Agents — contact center customer service representatives who spend the majority of their day handling
ACD-routed customer contacts
l
Supervisors — agents with supervisory duties over other agents. Agents are assigned to groups according
to their expertise and, if the contact center needs an administrative collection of agents different from
groups, to teams. Supervisors have supervision responsibilities and CCSP capabilities only for the agents
that are in their groups or teams. A supervisor not restricted to specific groups or teams has supervisory
capabilities over all agents in the contact center.
The Business User software license provides basic unified communication capabilities. A business user can only
be reached by direct dial or direct transfer. A business user cannot be a destination of CCSP ACD or participate
in outbound dialing campaigns. A business user without a CCSP UI license is not a CCSP UI user and cannot log
on to CCSP UI.
Agents and ReadyReps can be used as ACD destinations. Agent licenses are for traditional, formal contact
center agents. ReadyRep licenses are designed for use by people who are not solely or even primarily
dedicated to a formal contact center, but who need to be part of the contact center infrastructure in most other
ways. They are sometimes known as informal agents or experts, and their ACD use is part-time. Supervisors can
monitor and remotely manage agents and ReadyReps.
The instructions in this Help are for all users of CCSP UI. If a specific instruction is for an agent or a supervisor,
the instruction addresses agents or supervisors.

stand-alone without CCSP UI or alongside CCSP UI. When you use the alternative device with CCSP UI, you can
place and manage calls from both the phone and CCSP UI, and CCSP synchronizes call status on both the
phone and CCSP UI.
For instructions for your IP phone, see the user guide for your specific phone model. For Teams instructions,
see the Microsoft Teams Help.

      </p>
      <p>
       Log in and be available
If you have Teams enabled, your CCSP UI agent status and Teams presence are synchronized. See Become
available and released.
If you have an IP phone, it is set up as one of the following:
l
Permanent extension — is always assigned to a single telephone number.
l
Session-based extension — can be assigned different telephone numbers and therefore to different users. A
user begins a session by logging on to the phone.
The extension type determines how you log on and become available.
Permanent extension
If your phone is set up as a permanent extension, the number is automatically assigned when it is first started
so that you can receive direct calls. Optionally, you can also log on to CCSP UI to control your IP phone.
You cannot receive Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)-routed calls without using CCSP UI. If your position
requires you to receive ACD-routed calls, log on to CCSP UI and make yourself available there. You always
become available or unavailable through CCSP UI. See Become available and released.
When you exit CCSP UI, the ACD considers you logged on but unavailable for reporting purposes.
If you are not set up to receive ACD calls, you may still control your availability in CCSP UIfor reporting
purposes, but the availability setting will not affect your ability to receive direct inward dialed calls to your
phone number.
Session-based extension
If your phone is set up as a session-based extension, the phone can only be used when you are logged on. If
you try to place a call when the phone is not logged on, you receive an error message, such as Call Failed, and
an audible fast busy signal.
You have a numeric user ID, that is usually your phone extension number, as well as a numeric PIN. After you
log on to the phone, your phone number is assigned to the phone. If your administrator permits it, you can
receive direct inward dialed calls to your phone number.
Optionally, you can use the phone with CCSP UI. To do so, log on to CCSP UI with your alphanumeric user name
and alphanumeric password, that are usually different from the ID and PIN used for the IP phone. 
To make yourself available to receive ACD-routed calls, do one of the following:
l
Make yourself available from the IP phone.
l
Make yourself available from CCSP UI. See Become available and released.
When you change the status from one device, the status is automatically updated in the other device.
The mechanisms for logging on and becoming available vary from phone to phone.
Aastra phone
If you have an Aastra phone, it should have an ACD key that you use to manage the phone-based ACD features:

When you receive a call, the alternative device and CCSP UI both ring. Answer the call by:
l
IP phone — picking up the phone’s handset or pressing the IP phone's Speaker button.
l
Teams — clicking Answer in Teams.
If you selected Answer Calls Automatically in the CCSP UI preferences, then the phone also goes immediately
off-hook on the speakerphone, headset, or in Teams.
Hold a call on an alternative device
You can put a call on hold through CCSP UI or an alternative device.
You must release the call from hold with the same device that you used to put the call on hold.

Note
To transfer a call to the system, perform all the steps from CCSP UI.
You can transfer or conference a call through CCSP UI or an alternative device.
You must leave a conference or complete a transfer from the same device. For CCSP UI, see Transfer or

End a call on an alternative device
You can end the call from either CCSP UI or an alternative device.
If using CCSP UI and you can display wrap-up codes, then select the wrap-up code from CCSP UI.
Retrieve voicemail on an alternative device
To receive voicemail, your administrator or supervisor must give you a voice mailbox and a PIN. The PIN must
be a number.
When you have voicemail, the message waiting indicator appears in CCSP UI.
1.
Dial the voice mailbox. An audio message asks for your PIN.
2.
Click/press your PIN numbers on the device's dialpad.
3.
To send your PIN, click/press #. An audio message states the number of read messages and the number of

      <p>
       These fields serve as keywords for Contact Search. When the field name matches, the search shows all contacts
assigned to that field name in the results.
These fields in the database are defined by the Administrator. While you can assign these fields from Contact
History, you cannot create or edit them within Contact History. The same restrictions apply to the Organization
field.
Note
For the Administrator:
The Organization and custom fields are related to accounts and do not pertain to call history. You can
create a list of organizations in the database, or have a custom external import process manage this.
Custom fields consist of small lists of data that can be linked to an account, while organizations can be
represented in a larger list. Examples of custom fields include job titles, sites, or any other arbitrary
categories.
Related Accounts tab
The same name can be assigned to multiple contact accounts within different organizations with externally
imported data. Use the Related Accounts tab to view all the contact accounts with the same name as the

       Send direct message
Send Direct Message enables an agent to use Social Connector to proactively send messages ad-hoc without a
corresponding contact-center chat conversation.
For example, Twitter/X Tweets and Facebook posts can be queued for a CCSP agent to collect and respond to
without waiting for a subsequent response from the recipient.
From the perspective of Contact History, Send Direct Message enable agents to visually see the conversation
history, when the channel’s CDR is enabled in Social Connector.
Agents can see the conversation history from the History and the Contacts dashboards.
On the History dashboard, click the
Chat history icon to view all the historical conversations for the
identifier.
On the Contacts dashboard, on the Details tab, click the
Chat icon for the same view of all the historical
conversations for the identifier
CCSP UI Help - Agent - 7.4
124
      </p>
      <p>
       For more information, see Send an outbound message.
If there are more conversations than the configured limit a button will be presented at the top to allow the user
to get some previous conversations (the initial quantity loaded, and the amount subsequently loaded each time
are configurable – if users prefer to have fewer/more than currently they may contact their Administrators to
review changing):
The editor at the bottom may allow more text formatting than the channel permits, and most channels require
that the text is reformatted (for example, putting * either side to signify bold text) and this reformatted text is
displayed in this view when the conversation is revisited.  This is also performed by Social Connector status
messages, for example, where the text has _ either side for displaying in WhatsApp as italics.
Send Direct Message as a standalone gadget
Administrators can create and assign a standalone gadget in CCSP UI that enables the agent to send direct
messages through a specific media channel, such as SMS, WhatsApp, or Instagram messaging.
This customized gadget allows the agent to send a message directly without having to navigate through the
Contact History or Interactions pages.

History still displays the Add button – make sure, that the AccountDetailsIdentifier is exactly the same as in
ANI for example, +123@whatsapp.com and 123@whatsapp.com are different identifiers.
l
